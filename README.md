## Follow of working

- Create a R3F project
- Find or create a model
- Change the background's color
- Using drei to import that model into portfolio
- Change the "Environment" to have the light and the reflection on laptop screen
- <Float> has the float animation
- Instead of using <OrbitControls>, we use <PresentationControls> to have a better control of the camera (it lets you manipulate the model instead of the camera)
- touch-action of <canvas> need setting to "none" to prevent the scrolling of the page
- Use <ContactShadows>
- Put the <iframe> to display the website on laptop screen
- Use the <rectAreaLight> inside the float to have the light from the screen
